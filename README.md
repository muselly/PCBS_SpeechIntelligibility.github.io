# PCBS Project
## Brainstorming and References
Goal: something that has to do with digital signal processing and auditory stimuli (ideally music)
### IDEA #1: Speech Intelligibility Task
* Use MP's recordings
* Process them to add speech-shaped noise at 2 different frequency bands (below and above 2kHz)
* program task to play sound + ask user to input what they heard + score the response
* sounds are randomly selected from different sentences with random SNR ratios from 0,-3,-6,-9,-12 dB SNR (speech to noise)
* can then trace the speech intelligibility function in function of the frequency and SNR  

### IDEA #2: Effect of Timbre on Music Emotional perception
* Sliding scale ratings of valence and arousal (or corresponding measures)
* Manipulate extracts in function of timbre: change shape of spectrum (function of the spetrum shape... spectra centroid and variance of the spectral centroid)
* Could manipulate complexity of the melody: Randomly generate melodies that are more or less complex (rhythm/number of pitches/tones per second) and see how this affects emotion ratings...
* using what is known about effects of timbre (spectral centroid and variance of it for eg) to modify the spectral caracteristics of musical extracts in order to have different emotional responses

### IDEA #3 (all the other ideas)
1. beat-tracking algorithm
2. auditory sensitivity? (supra-threshold) (modulating loudness, timbre and collecting subjective pleasantness ratings? emotional arousal?)
3. automated staircase audiogram
4. program a task of emotional (arousal and valence) rating of musical extracts
